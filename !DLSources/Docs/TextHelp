	!DLSources - DeskLib Sources application directory
	


        Note: This is an old file. To see the full documentation,
              please load a web browser and try again.


This application directory contains all DeskLib code-files except for
the final libraries and headers, which are in the !DeskLib application.
It sets the system variable <DeskLib_Sources$Dir> to be the !DLSources
directory.

This directory is *not* needed for writing applications which use
DeskLib - the !DeskLib application contains all the headers and
libraries needed. All source code for DeskLib is contained in this
directory.

The 'Bin' directory contains a few of programs which I use to do various
things.

The 'Libraries' directory contains a separate directory for
each DeskLib sub-library.


Remaking DeskLib
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

The default setup is for Norcroft.  If you have GCC, the things you
need to uncomment in the Makefile should be obvious.  

We've changed the build system substantially from the previous 2.30 release,
partly so we can in future cross compile DeskLib, and partly to remove
the need for slightly unstable tools that we didn't have source for.

DeskLib requires GNU make - AMU isn't quite up to the job.  If you don't
already have GCC, then you can get this as part of the "utils" archive
from the latest GCC release:

http://gccsdk.riscos.info/

The rest of the system will build with tools from Castle's 32-bit release.
Don't try and rebuild DeskLib with a 26-bit compiler - you'll just end up
with a broken library. GCC should be able to build it fine too. Again, you'll
require a 32-bit version of GCC.

In general, using libraries such as DeskLib between UnixLib and
SharedCLibrary programs isn't a good idea, as they have some
incompatibilities.  DeskLib has been checked to ensure that it is
compatible with both C libraries.  Visit http://www.riscos.info/unixlib/
if you wish to know more.

Just running "make" is sufficient to build everything.



Fairly complete description of all files in this !DLSources directory
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

Here is what is where:


!Boot		Sets the system variable DeskLib_Source$Dir to point to
		this directory.

!Run		Simply runs !Boot.

!Help		This file.

!Sprites	The !DLSources sprite - a green version of the normal
		DeskLib sprite.

Libraries.	Every DeskLib sub-library's source, makefiles etc.
	
	<Lib-name>.
		
		Every sublibrary has the following
		source-directories:
		
		c.	C source
		s.	Assembler source
		h.	Internal headers 
		


OtherLibs.	A few libraries which aren't part of the main DeskLib
		library-files.
	
	Debugs.		Some alternative debugging libraries
	
		Makefile	This puts the different debugging
				libraries into <DeskLib$Dir>.o.Debug.
		o.
		c.
	
	SmallError.	An alternative to the standard Error library.
			It sends error messages to stderr. Useful for
			using Error_Report* in command line programs.
			The generated library is 
			'<DeskLib>.Other.SmError'.


	
	MkClientOs	Makes .o files suitable for static linking with
			a client application. Used for libraries which
			aren't available as a DLL.
