    Author:  Copyright © 1993 Shaun Blackmore, Julian Smith
    Version: 1.03 (17 Apr 2005)
    Purpose: Assembler SWI veneers for the Font Manager
             NOTE that some names are not strictly 'DeskLib' style, to keep
             them consistent with the SWIs they represent ("Converttopoints",
             etc). However, macros with 'DeskLib' naming are provided to allow
             either naming style to be used.
    Mods:    08 Jul 1995 - Julian Smith - Added Font_Paint3 for use with RISC
                                          OS 3. Also various macros for the
                                          'plottype' argument of Font_Paint3.
             23 Oct 2007: Removed Font_Plot from documentation, changed names
                          to meet DeskLib naming standards

  'string' contains the string to be painted.  This may include a number of

  colours according to the results of a call to ColourTrans_SetFontColours.
  Other control sequences are 9,dx_low,dx_middle,dx_high which allows x
  movement within a string, and the y-axis equivalent using control code
  11, which can be useful for subscripts, tabs, and the like.  You can change
  the font by using 26,font_handle, and enable underlining by using
  25,line_position,line_thickness.  The underline position is a signed number
  in 256ths of the font size, relative to the baseline of the current font.
  The thickness is in the same units, but unsigned.

  a coordinate block for justification or a rubout box, or are giving a
  transformation matrix to be used, as these are always specified in
  millipoints.

  You can use font_STRLEN and given a string length in 'length' if you want
  to print a substring of the given string - it will then stop painting after
  that character, though the next character in the string may be accessed to
  gather formatting information.

  If you set font_plot_GIVENHANDLE then 'font' is used as the initial font
  handle for plotting.  This can be zero to use the currently set font.

  Any parameters which the flags say you are not using (eg. 'transformation'
  if you haven't set font_plot_TANSMATRIX) can safely be NULL.

  to and returned from Font_ScanString.  This should be a bitwise-ORed
  combination of the ScanString-specific font_scan_CARET, font_scan_USEBLOCK,
  font_scan_BBOX, font_scan_RETURNCOUNT and font_scan_RETURNTRANSMATRIX, and
  the flags shared with Font_Paint3 which are font_plot_TRANSMATRIX,
  font_plot_GIVENHANDLE, font_STRLEN, font_plot_KERN and font_plot_RIGHTTOLEFT.

  'x' and 'y' are offsets from the start of the string.  When determining the
  caret position (when the font_scan_CARET flag has been set), these specify
  the offset from the start of the string to the mouse click.  Otherwise they
  are the width and height to be used when determining the split point.  On
  exit from the function, these are filled with the actual offset to the caret
  position or the split point, respectively.

  On exit, 'end' will be updated to point to the position in the string
  where the scan ended.  If the font_scan_CARET flag has been set this will be
  the caret position, otherwise it will be the split point or the end of the
  string if no splitting was required.  If you do not need to know where the
  scan ended, you can pass NULL to ignore the returned value.

  If the font_scan_USEBLOCK or font_scan_BBOX flags are set, then 'block'
  should point to a block containing any additional offsets to be used when
  scanning, and a split character (or -1 to indicate no split character).  In
  the font_scan_BBOX case, it will be updated to contain the bounding box of
  the string on exit from the function.

  If the font_plot_TRANSMATRIX or font_scan_RETURNTRANSMATRIX flags are set,
  then 'transformation' points to a transformation matrix to use when scanning
  the string.  This will be updated to hold the matrix applying at the end of
  the string on exit from the function if you use the RETURNTRANSMATRIX form.

  If the font_STRLEN or font_scan_RETURNCOUNT flags are set then on entry
  'length' should contain the length of the substring to use when scanning
  the string.  In the RETURNCOUNT case, 'length' will be updated on exit to
  contain the number of split characters encountered, or if no split character
  is specified then the number of printable characters encountered.

  'font' will only be used if you set the font_plot_GIVENHANDLE flag,
  otherwise the current font will be used.  You can set the flag and still
  use the current font by passing zero for 'font'.

  If the font_plot_RIGHTTOLEFT flag has been set, you would normally pass
  a negative value of 'x', as this means that the scan continues until the
  x offset is less than this value - generally more appropriate for
  right-to-left plotting.
