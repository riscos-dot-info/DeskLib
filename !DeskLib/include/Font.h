    Version: 1.02 (08 Jul 1995)
    Purpose: Assembler SWI veneers for the Font Manager
             NOTE that some names are not strictly 'DeskLib' style, to keep
             them consistent with the SWIs they represent ("Converttopoints",
             etc). However, macros with 'DeskLib' naming are provided to allow
             either naming style to be used.
    Mods:    08 Jul 1995 - Julian Smith - Added Font_Paint3 for use with RISC
                                          OS 3. Also various macros for the
                                          'plottype' argument of Font_Paint3.

/* Abstract */
/*
  This header provides assembler veneers for the FontManager SWIs.

  Some of the names are not strictly in the DeskLib style, instead they
  are consistent with the SWIs they correspond to, eg. Font_Converttopoints.
  For these cases, macros with the DeskLib style are provided to allow
  either style to be used.

  Other control sequences are 9,dx_low,dx_middle,dx_high which allows x

  11, which can be useful for subscripts, tabs, and the like.  You can change

  You can use font_STRLEN and given a string length in 'length' if you want
  to print a substring of the given string - it will then stop painting after
  that character, though the next character in the string may be accessed to
  gather formatting information.

  If you set font_plot_GIVENHANDLE then 'font' is used as the initial font
  handle for plotting.  This can be zero to use the currently set font.

  This function scans a string as if it were being painted to screen with
  Font_Paint3, and returns various data about it.  It can be used to find
  the bounding box of a string, the position of the caret in the string
  or to find where to split a line, if at all.

  The string to be scanned is in the format used by Font_Paint3 - it can
  contain various escape sequences some of which are described in the
  information with Font_Paint3 and the full details of which can be found in
  the PRMs.

  Note that unlike the Font_Paint calls Font_ScanString deals exclusively with
  coordinates in millipoints.  If you need OS unit values you should convert to
  and from millipoints, for example by using Font_ConvertToPoints.

  'flags' contains the flags which determine exactly what information is passed
  to and returned from Font_ScanString.  This should be a bitwise-ORed
  combination of the ScanString-specific font_scan_CARET, font_scan_USEBLOCK,
  font_scan_BBOX, font_scan_RETURNCOUNT and font_scan_RETURNTRANSMATRIX, and
  the flags shared with Font_Paint3 which are font_plot_TRANSMATRIX,
  font_plot_GIVENHANDLE, font_STRLEN, font_plot_KERN and font_plot_RIGHTTOLEFT.

  'x' and 'y' are offsets from the start of the string.  When determining the
  caret position (when the font_scan_CARET flag has been set), these specify
  the offset from the start of the string to the mouse click.  Otherwise they
  are the width and height to be used when determining the split point.  On
  exit from the function, these are filled with the actual offset to the caret
  position or the split point, respectively.

  On exit, 'end' will be updated to point to the position in the string
  where the scan ended.  If the font_scan_CARET flag has been set this will be
  the caret position, otherwise it will be the split point or the end of the
  string if no splitting was required.  If you do not need to know where the
  scan ended, you can pass NULL to ignore the returned value.

  If the font_scan_USEBLOCK or font_scan_BBOX flags are set, then 'block'
  should point to a block containing any additional offsets to be used when
  scanning, and a split character (or -1 to indicate no split character).  In
  the font_scan_BBOX case, it will be updated to contain the bounding box of
  the string on exit from the function.

  If the font_plot_TRANSMATRIX or font_scan_RETURNTRANSMATRIX flags are set,
  then 'transformation' points to a transformation matrix to use when scanning
  the string.  This will be updated to hold the matrix applying at the end of
  the string on exit from the function if you use the RETURNTRANSMATRIX form.

  If the font_STRLEN or font_scan_RETURNCOUNT flags are set then on entry
  'length' should contain the length of the substring to use when scanning
  the string.  In the RETURNCOUNT case, 'length' will be updated on exit to
  contain the number of split characters encountered, or if no split character
  is specified then the number of printable characters encountered.

  'font' will only be used if you set the font_plot_GIVENHANDLE flag,
  otherwise the current font will be used.  You can set the flag and still
  use the current font by passing zero for 'font'.

  If the font_plot_RIGHTTOLEFT flag has been set, you would normally pass
  a negative value of 'x', as this means that the scan continues until the
  x offset is less than this value - generally more appropriate for
  right-to-left plotting.
